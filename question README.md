# Tourist-Data-Analysis-
Tourist Data Analysis (MY WAYS PYTHON ASSIGMENT)




 

Project Overview:
In this project, you will analyze the dataset 'Tourism in the Indian States' from 2016-2019, and will share the ﬁndings about it. You will use Python Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly (optional) libraries to make your analysis easier.
What do I need to install?
You will need the installation of Python and the following libraries
•Numpy
•Pandas
•Matplotlib
•Plotly (optional)
•csv or unicodecsv
We recommend installing Python from python.org or using Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as an IPython/Jupiter notebook to work on the project.
Why this project?
This project will introduce you to the data analysis process. You will also go through the entire process of data analysis that a data analyst would do. You will gain experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly(optional), learned in Python Course Practicum+, which makes writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:
•Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
•Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
•Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
•Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
•Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
 

•Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
•Know how to use Matplotlib and Plotly to produce plots showing your ﬁndings Why is this important to my career?
This project will show oﬀ a variety of data analysis skills, as well as show potential employers that you know how to go through the entire data analysis process.
Project Details:
Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly. Over 18.93 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2019 compared to 10.56 million in 2018, representing a growth of 3.5%
For this project, you will conduct your own data analysis of Tourism in Indian States' from 2016- 2019 and create a ﬁle to share that documents your ﬁndings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
Note: You will not be required to use statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your ﬁndings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

Step 1: Choose your Data Set
Choose one of the following sources to download the dataset to analyze your project. Download the dataset from Tourist data in PDF format and Tourist data in CSV format. You might want to use some other python libraries to extract the tables from the PDF ﬁles into CSV format.
Step 2: Get Organized
Create a project folder that contains the dataset, python code, and your ﬁndings.
You may wish to use the IPython/Jupiter notebook, in which case you can share both the code you wrote and the report of your ﬁndings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to store your report and code separately.
Step 3: Analyze your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. Here are some ideas to get you started:
•Tourism Data
◦	Top states which attract more tourists?
 
◦	Rate of growth across years
◦	Map plot to highlight the states which attract more tourists
Step 4: Share your Findings
Once you have ﬁnished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the ﬁndings you found most interesting. You might wish to use the IPython/Jupiter notebook to share your ﬁndings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis, but you can also use another tool if you wish.
Project Evaluation:
Your project will be evaluated based on the project speciﬁcations mentioned here. We would suggest going through the project speciﬁcations before submitting the project to make sure it meets them in order to complete.
